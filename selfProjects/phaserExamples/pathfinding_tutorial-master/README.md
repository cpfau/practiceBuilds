 ## Running the demo ##
 
 Place all the files on your local web server and navigate to index.html.

You can move around by clicking on the map. The colored areas are tiles that have a cost attached to them, so the pathfinding algorithm witll try to avoid them if possible (unless all alternative paths are much longer).
